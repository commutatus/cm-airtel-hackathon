# Problem Statement

It's expensive to give a 24x7 support to resolve queries and complaints of students and their guardians. At the same time keeping learners engaged with the platform so that they spend enough time working on the lessons and assignments of the course.

We are building a knowledge base of FAQs with conversational AI that would help resolve approx. 90% of the queries. It would also send nudges to the students on WhatsApp so that they don't lose the touch with the course.

We want to help companies spend more time on creating good content for the courses rather than spend resources on solving general user queries and finding out ways of keeping learners glued to the platform.
